# Wikipedia TeX Source Extractor

Wikipedia TeX Source Extractor (WTSE) is a Greasemonkey user script that allows you to extract the TeX source from an image of a formula on Wikipedia.

Just click on the desired formula and you're good to go.

You can find the [WTSE Greasemonkey script on userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/121713), too.
